## Current Projects

I am seeking motivated and interested undergraduate and graduate students to join my research team. We are currently seeking data analysts and research assistant to help us process and understand vast amounts of information.

Skills in R (ggplot2, survival, etc.) are essential for this position, as you will be responsible for using this programming language to manipulate, manage, and analyze data. You will be an integral part of our team, working alongside undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students to develop and test new research ideas. This is an excellent opportunity for individuals who are interested in health research and wish to gain valuable experience in data analysis and scientific inquiry. If you have a passion for understanding complex data and are excited about the possibility of contributing to groundbreaking research, we would love to have you join our team.
